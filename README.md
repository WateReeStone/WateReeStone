\Hello,bro. I am WateReeStone, this is a nickname combining three words which is created by myself.<br />
\I'm new to github and I'm not good at programming due to some reasons, I'll explain it soon after. But from today onward, I decide to restart my learning plan in programming and other techs.<br />
\But before it, I'd like to use this github space as my prviate note repository first, I like reading books about philosophy and social science like political economy and sociology. After I bought a kindle and downloaded many books from the Internet, I keep noting them down using WORD, but I seldom using it cloud sync service for reviewing my notes becasue my mobile phone is hard to access the cloud service, meanwhile, it may be lost if my disk goes wrong and some other accidents, so I decide to post them into github for more everlasting storage.<br />
\You may guess the reason that I'm weak in programming and engeering. Because I hate the ideaology that vaunting science and engeering can solve every problems we now face. This ideology is very common, I can say that it is the most important ideology and a key component of captalism. So I was hating to learn science and engeering while I got good grade in the college.<br />
\As to my learning plan, I will research in robotics field, but my programming skill and related theory knowledge is weak, so I will post my notes recording the my progress in learning robotics, maths, C language, linux system, ROS and so on and so on. <br />
\I know it may hard for me to learn both engeering and philosphy, but I'll try my best to reach this goal because, for me, philosophy makes me know the status of science in our world(not nature world, but human world, more specially speaking, human society). science and engeering can provide me with some new perspectives to think about the real problems.<br />
\That's all, I hope I can beb instant on my plan.<br />
